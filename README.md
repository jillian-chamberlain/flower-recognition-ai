# Flower Recognition AI

## Overview

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based AI program designed to classify flower images into five categories: daisy, rose, sunflower, tulip, and dandelion. The program supports human interaction by allowing users to upload images of flowers and receive predictions along with descriptive information, helping users identify flower types accurately.

## Features

- Deep learning model (CNN) trained on a flower image dataset.
- Automated dataset download and setup on the first run.
- Hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy.
- Expert system logic providing warnings on low-confidence predictions.
- Knowledge representation using `flower_info.json` containing flower descriptions.
- User input for uploading and classifying new flower images.
- Visual output displaying the flower image with predicted label and confidence.
